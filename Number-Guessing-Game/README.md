## ✨ Features

### 🎯 Core Gameplay
- A secret number is randomly generated based on the selected difficulty
- Player guesses the number within a limited number of tries
- After each guess, hints narrow down the search range in real time

### 🌡️ Hot-Cold Meter
- A visual gradient bar slides from ❄️ cold (far away) to 🔥 hot (very close)
- Updates on every guess so players can feel proximity intuitively

### 🎚️ Difficulty Levels

| Level  | Range  | Tries | Base Score |
|--------|--------|-------|------------|
| Easy   | 1–50   | 12    | 100 pts    |
| Medium | 1–100  | 10    | 200 pts    |
| Hard   | 1–200  | 8     | 400 pts    |

### 🏆 Score & Streak System
- Score = Base points + (tries remaining × 15) + (streak × 25)
- Win streak multiplies your bonus — keep it alive!
- Session best score tracked and displayed live

### 🏅 Leaderboard (localStorage)
- Top scores are saved to `localStorage` and persist across sessions
- Displayed on the Start Screen with gold/silver/bronze ranks
- Clearable with one click

### 🔊 Sound Effects
- Distinct tones for: guess click, too high, too low, win (ascending chord), lose (descending)
- Built with the Web Audio API — zero audio files needed

### 🎉 Animations
- Confetti burst on win
- Shake animation on invalid input
- Score pop when points are earned
- Sliding dot tracker per guess (color-coded: red = too high, blue = too low, green = win)
- Ambient particle network background
